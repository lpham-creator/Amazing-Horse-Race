## Group Contract
_Note: In the space provided below create a group contract with your team. This is where you discuss any norms and rules you want to establish so that everyone works well together._

**Participation**: 
Agreed Group Deadlines- give us a decent heads up(1-2 days ahead of time) if you can't complete something before a deadline so we can figure it out.  

Debugging done in the partner coding format, in person ideally

Work separately when possible. 

_Note: all members must equal share the responsibility of programming (i.e., writing code) and other creative aspects (i.e., research about characters, questions, narratives). Each member must be able to explain ALL parts of the program at demo day and upon submission. If individuals do not participate in programming activities, they may receive a failing grade._

**Communication**: 
Communication- Let us know what's going on!

Updates on the weekends on where you're at via text.


**Meetings**: 
M, W, F after class, in person but not necesarily. 1 hour duration.

Be Flexible with scheduling meetings.

We agree to....    "insert when you plan to meet, should people arrive on-time, is it come and go, can people miss a meeting, what will happen at the meeting, how long will they be"


**Conduct**: 
Write code during testing phases in separate doc, share with other group members. Paste in once it's polished.  

Make sure your code is readable as you write it. Variable naming conventions, good comments.

We agree to...     "what are the dos and don'ts for group members, how can each member hold each other accountable"


**Conflict**: 
If there is a conflict we can sit down in person. If there is a question text someone directly. Get teacher as mediator as needed.

We agree that conflicts are normal in any group...you just need a plan ahead of time.


**Other**: We agree to always communicate and update each other about our progress if we work separately.
