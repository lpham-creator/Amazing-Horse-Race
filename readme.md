1. Introduction:
   The Amazing Horse Race is a virtual racing game where players can raise and modify the stats of their horses. You will get to compete against legendary horses. There are three rounds in total.

3. Installation:
* This project runs on Python 3 and requires graphics.py version 5.0 and testsuite.py. Information on these two modules can be accessed in the directory. The sprites folder(/sprites) contains all graphic images required for this game. All image source information is under /docs/Game Images. horsedata2.csv contains information needed to initialize the horse objects in the game. The docs folder(/docs) contains our design plan(design.md), planning images(IMG_2022...), and work log(work_log.md).  

4. Instructions:
* Welcome to The Amazing Horse Race! You can choose your own horse and race him against other famous horses. After two rounds you get to combat Secretariet - a legendary racing horse.

Each horse has distinct base stats: Speed, Stamina and Strength. Before each race you will have a chance to split 10 points across your horse's stats. You will then find out which horse you will be competing against. The winning horse has the highest combined stats. There is a special priority bonus you can earn. After the race, the game will choose a stat randomly to prioritize. If, for your horse, the chosen stat is greater than 80, your horse will gain an additional 20 points. You will have two chances to race against different horses before you race against Secretariat - our strongest horse.

5. Troubleshooting:
* If the game/graphics has trouble displaying, you can hit start and try again.
* If the game seems to freeze, try clicking the screen.
* If you enter the wrong inputs and the game does not prompt you to re-enter the input, restart the game.
