### Prototype I - Feedback

**Headers**: Almost complete, thanks. 

**Read Me**:  Great initial read me explanation. Keep updating this file as you develop your project.  

**Group Contract**:  Complete, please review this contract periodically and use it if you experience conflict. 

**Sprint Planning**: Complete, great job!   

**Code/Program**: Good job so far! Your prototype looks to be in good shape, and nice use of classes. The only thing I would recommend is adding more variability so that the horse stats aren't as static.   

**Other Comments**:  Keep working hard on your project. Developing things from scratch takes time.
